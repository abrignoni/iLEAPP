''' applicationStateDB.py - artifact plugin for applicationState.db

This artifact plugin analyses applicationState.db files. The original plugin by
Alexis Brignoni had basic support for applicationState.db files by extracting
bundleIdentifier, bundlePath and sandboxPath. This new version includes a
refactored version of the original plugin and adds support for
XBApplicationSnapshotManifest BLOBs in applicationState.db records.

Initial experiments on an iPhone 8 with iOS version 16.7.7 indicate that the
timestamps in these BLOBs are only stored or updated at a moment when a user
interacts with a device, for example when switching between apps using the app
selector. Note that the timestamps do not necessarily reflect the moment at
which the corresponding app was actively used in the foreground, so be careful
with the interpretation of these records.

When the device in our experiment was left untouched for a period of hours or
days, the timestamps were not updated. This indicates that the timestamps can
be used to investigate hypothesis concerning user-activity at the specific time
periods. A write-up of our experiments will be published online at which point
a link will be added to this plugin.

The XBApplicationSnapshotManifest BLOBs in applicationState.db are
related to .ktx files, for which support is also already available in iLEAPP in
the appSnapshots.py artifact script. However, in absence of .ktx files (i.e.
with a Logical dump), parsing the relevant timestamps from applicationState.db
can still be beneficial. Thus this additional artifact plugin.
