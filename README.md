```

To run on **Linux**, you will also need to install `tkinter` separately like so:

```
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
```

## Compile to executable

To compile to an executable so you can run this on a system without python installed.

```
pyinstaller --onefile ileapp.spec
````

```
pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole ileappGUI.spec
```
